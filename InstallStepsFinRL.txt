Installing Finrl package
Note : This works only for python version >= 3.10 and < 3.11. Since I am using python 3.11.5, I created a virtual environment to make it work in my IDE without actually changing its current version, which is compatible for my most of the other projects.
1.  git clone https://github.com/AI4Finance-LLC/FinRL-Library.git
2.  cd FinRL-Library
3.  conda create --name myenv python=3.10.11
4. conda activate myenv
5. pip install -—upgrade pip
   pip install --upgrade setuptools
6. xcode-select --install
7. brew update
   brew upgrade
8. cd finrl
9. pip install -r requirements.txt
10. pip install .
11. If this error - “        ERROR: Failed building wheel for qdldl
      Failed to build qdldl
      ERROR: Could not build wheels for qdldl, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects
      [end of output]
  
  note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.
error: subprocess-exited-with-error
”
Then do - 1. git clone https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/qdldl.git   
             cd ldldl  
          2. conda install -c conda-forge cmake
          3. mkdir build
             cd build
             cmake ..
             cmake --build 
          4. sudo make install
12. Go back to finrl folder using cd .. ; cd ..
13. pip install osqp==0.6.2
14. pip install .
15. After completion, 
    python
Python 3.10.11 (main, May 17 2023, 14:30:36) [Clang 14.0.6 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import finrl
If completes successfully, finrl is successfully installed.
16. To use this, we need to work on spider in virtual environment. To do that - 
    1. conda install spyder-kernels
    2. python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
    3. Copy the output of the above command. Launch Spyder. Go to preferences >> Python Interpreter >> Use this python interpreter. Paste the output of above command and click Apply. Open a new console and everything in the virtual environment can be used there. 
17. If any new package is needed to be installed for this project, it would be needed to be installed in this virtual environment only. Do “conda activate myenv” in the terminal to activate this virtual environment, “conda deactivate” to go back to base environment.
